## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Criteria

> [!NOTE]
> The following are developer friendly images and comments to explain what will be accepted as done.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend API
    participant Database

    Client->>Frontend: Click "Delete User"
    Frontend->>Backend API: DELETE /users/{id}
    Backend API->>Database: DELETE FROM users WHERE id = {id}
    Database-->>Backend API: User deleted
    Backend API-->>Frontend: 200 OK (User Deleted)
    Frontend-->>Client: Show success message
```

I want a `deleteUser` endpoint that takes a user `id` and deletes them from the database.

The endpoint should return with whether it was successful or not at deleting the user.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

> [!NOTE]
> The following are what the unit tests expect once development is done.

When the `deleteUser` endpoint gets a request with **no** `id` I **EXPECT**:
- The request to return with a failing status code and a message explaining why it failed, "No ID was supplied."

---

When the `deleteUser` endpoint gets a request with a  `id` where the user exists I **EXPECT**:
- The backend to send a query to the database to delete that user.
- The request to return with a successful status code (200) if the database was successful with deleting the user.

---

When the `deleteUser` endpoint gets a request with a `id` where the user doesn't exist I **EXPECT**:
- The backend to send a query to the database to delete that user.
- The database to return an error since it can't find the user.
- The request to return with a NOT FOUND status code (404) since the database couldn't find the user and a error message saying "User could not be deleted since it wasn't found."
